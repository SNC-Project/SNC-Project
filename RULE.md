## RULE

Each team member uploads something related to his or her field, and we all edit each other's code with the goal of making it better.

Each piece of code is free for the world to use as they please, as long as they license it. 

---
As a rule of thumb, you should post your code along with an explanation of what it is. If you fix another teammate's code, you should include an analysis.

All code can be shared, so don't ask for copyright.
